	abstract = {A new numerical framework for solving conservation laws is being developed. This new framework differs substantially in both concept and methodology from the well-established methods, i.e., finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and spectral methods. It is conceptually simple and designed to overcome several key limitations of the above traditional methods. A two-level scheme for solving the convection-diffusion equation [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]t + a [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]x - [mu] [not partial differential]2u/[not partial differential]x2 = 0 ([mu] {\textgreater}= 0) is constructed and used to illuminate major differences between the present method and those mentioned above. This explicit scheme, referred to as the a-[mu] scheme, has two independent marching variables unj and (ux)nj which are the numerical analogues of u and [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]x at (j, n), respectively. The a-[mu] scheme has the unusual property that its stability is limited only by the CFL condition, i.e., it is independent of [mu]. Also it can be shown that the amplification factors of the a -[mu] scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme if [mu] = O, and to those of the DuFort-Frankel scheme if a = O. These coincidences are unexpected because the a-[mu] scheme and the above classical schemes are derived from completely different perspectives, and the a -[mu] scheme does not reduce to the above classical schemes in the limiting cases. The a-[mu] scheme is extended to solve the 1D time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations of a perfect gas. Stability of this explicit solver also is limited only by the CFL condition. In spite of the fact that it does not use (i) any techniques related to the high-resolution upwind methods, and (ii) any ad hoc parameter, the current Navier-Stokes solver is capable of generating highly accurate shock tube solutions. Particularly, for high-Reynolds-number flows, shock discontinuities can be resolved within one mesh interval. The inviscid ([mu] = 0) a-[mu] scheme is reversible in time. It also is neutrally stable, i.e., free from numerical dissipation. Such a scheme generally cannot be extended to solve the Euler equations. Thus, the inviscid version is modified. Stability of this modified scheme, referred to as the a-[var epsilon] scheme, is limited by the CFL condition and 0 {\textless}= [var epsilon] {\textless}= 1, where [var epsilon] is a special parameter that controls numerical dissipation. Moreover, if [var epsilon] = 0, the amplification factors of the a-[var epsilon] scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme, which has no numerical dissipation. On the other hand, if [var epsilon] = 1, the two amplification factors of the a-[var epsilon] scheme become the same function of the Courant number and the phase angle. Unexpectedly, this function also is the amplification factor of the highly diffusive Lax scheme. Note that, because the Lax scheme is very diffusive and it uses a mesh that is staggered in time, a two-level scheme using such a mesh is often associated with a highly diffusive scheme. The a-[var epsilon] scheme, which also uses a mesh staggering in time, demonstrates that it can also be a scheme with no numerical dissipation. The Euler extension of the a -[var epsilon] scheme has stability conditions similar to those of the a -epsiv; scheme itself. It has the unusual property that numerical dissipation at all mesh points can be controlled by a set of local parameters, Moreover, it is capable of generating accurate shock tube solutions with the CFL number ranging from close to 1 to 0.022},

	abstract = {A new high-resolution and genuinely multidimensional numerical method for solving conservation laws is being developed. It was designed to avoid the limitations of the traditional methods and was built from ground zero with extensive physics considerations. Nevertheless, its foundation is mathematically simple enough that one can build from it a coherent, robust, efficient, and accurate numerical framework. Two basic beliefs that set the new method apart from the established methods are at the core of its development. The first belief is that, in order to capture physics more efficiently and realistically, the modeling focus should be placed on the original integral form of the physical conservation laws, rather than the differential form. The latter form follows from the integral form under the additional assumption that the physical solution is smooth, an assumption that is difficult to realize numerically in a region of rapid change, such as a boundary layer or a shock. The second belief is that, with proper modeling of the integral and differential forms themselves, the resulting numerical solution should automatically be consistent with the properties derived from the integral and differential forms, e.g., the jump conditions across a shock and the properties of characteristics. Therefore a much simpler and more robust method can be developed by avoiding the explicit use of the above derived properties. Specifically, to capture physics as fully as possible, the method requires that: (i) space and time be unified and treated as a single entity; (ii) both local and global flux conservation in space and time be enforced; and (iii) a multidimensional scheme be constructed without using the dimensional-splitting approach, such that multidimensional effects and source terms (which are scalars) can be modeled more realistically. To simplify mathematics and broaden its applicability as much as possible, the method attempts to use the simplest logical structures and approximation techniques. Specifically, (i) it uses a staggered space-time mesh such that flux at any interface separating two conservation elements can be evaluated internally in a simpler and more consistent manner, without using a separate flux model; (ii) it avoids the use of many well-established techniques such as Riemann solvers, flux splittings, and monotonicity constraints such that the complications and possibly even the limitations associated with them may be avoided; and (iii) it avoids the use of special techniques that are not applicable to more general problems. Furthermore, triangles in 2D space and tetrahedrons in 3D space are used as the basic building blocks of the spatial meshes, such that the method (i) can be used to construct 2D and 3D nondissipative schemes in a natural manner; and (ii) is compatible with the simplest unstructured meshes. Note that while numerical dissipation is required for shock capturing, it may also result in annihilation of small disturbances such as sound waves and, in the case of flow with a large Reynolds number, may overwhelm physical dissipation. To overcome this difficulty, two different and mutually complementary types of adjustable numerical dissipation are introduced in the present development.},
