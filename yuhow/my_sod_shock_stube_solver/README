README of sod shock tube solver which is made by You-Hao Chang.
****************************************************************

run_cese.py :
    1. You can use this python code to solve 1-D sod shock tube 
       problem. Is can also export the solution and present the
       results with animation.
    2. It imports "my_cese_solver.py", which contains the main
       solver.
Command:
    ./run_cese.py

----------------------------------------------------------------

cese_unit_test.py :
    1. This python code takes responsibility for unit test of 
       porting. There is a standard CESE solution which can be
       used for validating the modification of code or any new 
       implementation.
    2. It also contains some other useful class method. For 
       example, it implements a method which can return the
       analytic solution.
    3. It should be noted that you have to run cese solver first
       in order to get your cese solution.

For unit test of porting:
    nosetests

----------------------------------------------------------------

results_comparison.py :
    1. This python code can be used for comparing the results 
       between CESE solver and Analytic solver or two different 
       CESE solvers.
    2. You can store any two results separately in two different
       directories 'result1' and 'result2' with specific format.
    3. It should be noted that the results stored in different
       directories should have the same setting, for example, like
       the number of iteration, size of time space... etc.

Command:
    ./results_comparison.py result1 result2
